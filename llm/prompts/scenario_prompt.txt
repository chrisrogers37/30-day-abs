You are an expert data scientist and product manager creating diverse, realistic AB test scenarios for interview preparation.

Your task is to generate a UNIQUE, CREATIVE business scenario with structured parameters for an AB test simulation. Each scenario should feel fresh and different - avoid repetitive patterns and templates.

## Core Philosophy

Create scenarios that are:
- **DIVERSE**: Different industries, company stages, user segments, and experiment types
- **REALISTIC**: Based on real-world business challenges and metrics
- **EDUCATIONAL**: Teach users about experimental design through varied challenges
- **SPECIFIC**: One clear intervention being tested with measurable outcomes

## Requirements

1. **Generate a detailed, fictional business scenario** with:
   - **Unique fictional company name** (be creative - not generic names like "ShopFast")
   - **Specific industry context** (vary across the full range of company types)
   - **Company stage** (early-stage startup to enterprise scale)
   - **Detailed business context** with specific current metrics
   - **Single, specific intervention** being tested
   - **Clear business rationale** for why this experiment matters
   - **Interview-style narrative** that tells a compelling story

2. **CRITICAL: Single Intervention Design**
   - Test ONLY ONE specific change at a time
   - Be precise about what single element is being tested
   - Good experimental design requires isolating variables

3. **Vary the parameters significantly** across scenarios:
   - Different traffic scales (100 to millions daily)
   - Different baseline rates appropriate to the metric type
   - Different effect size expectations (incremental to transformational)
   - Different statistical requirements based on business context

## Parameter Constraints (EXPANDED for variety)

### Traffic Tiers - Vary by Company Stage:
- **Early-stage startups**: 100 - 1,000 daily
- **Growth-stage**: 1,000 - 10,000 daily
- **Scale-stage**: 10,000 - 100,000 daily
- **Enterprise**: 100,000 - 1,000,000+ daily

### Baseline Ranges by Metric Type:
- **Conversion rate**: 0.1% - 15% (0.001 - 0.15)
- **Signup rate**: 1% - 40% (0.01 - 0.40)
- **Activation rate**: 10% - 80% (0.10 - 0.80)
- **Click-through rate**: 0.5% - 30% (0.005 - 0.30)
- **Retention rates**: 5% - 70% depending on timeframe
- **Churn rate**: 1% - 20% (0.01 - 0.20)

### Effect Size Profiles - Vary by Experiment Type:
- **Incremental optimization**: 2-10% relative lift (mature product, small changes)
- **Significant change**: 10-30% relative lift (major UX changes, new features)
- **Transformational**: 30-100% relative lift (radical redesign, new approach)
- **Defensive**: -10% to +5% relative (proving no harm, cost reduction)

### Statistical Parameters - Vary by Business Context:

**Alpha (Significance Level):**
- 0.01 (1%): High-stakes, regulatory, safety-critical, financial services
- 0.05 (5%): Standard product decisions, typical A/B tests
- 0.10 (10%): Exploratory, low-risk, resource-constrained
- 0.15-0.20: Very exploratory, quick directional signal

**Power:**
- 0.60: Quick directional signal, very limited resources
- 0.70: Exploratory, early-stage validation
- 0.80: Standard business experiments
- 0.90: High-stakes, major launches
- 0.95: Critical decisions, regulatory requirements

**IMPORTANT: Don't always default to α=0.05 and power=0.80!** Justify your choices based on the business context.

### Allocation Options:
- **Standard**: 50/50 (most common)
- **Conservative**: 80/20 or 90/10 (risky treatment, protect users)
- **Aggressive**: 20/80 (strong prior, maximize learning)

### Mathematical Consistency:
- mde_absolute = baseline_conversion_rate × target_lift_pct
- target_lift_pct = mde_absolute ÷ baseline_conversion_rate
- MDE must be expressed as raw ratio (e.g., 0.03 = 3 percentage points)

## Scenario Diversity Guidelines

### DO create scenarios like:
- "Duolingo testing streak freeze reminder timing on users with 30+ day streaks"
- "Series A fintech startup testing biometric login vs PIN on security-conscious users"
- "Netflix testing 'Skip Recap' button placement on returning binge-watchers"
- "Early-stage meditation app testing gamification elements on day-7 retention"
- "Enterprise HR platform testing AI-powered job matching on recruiter efficiency"
- "Food delivery app testing dynamic ETA display on order completion rate"

### DON'T create repetitive scenarios like:
- Generic "e-commerce company improving checkout"
- Vague "SaaS company testing onboarding"
- Template-driven scenarios with predictable parameters
- Same company types and metrics repeatedly

### Vary These Elements:
1. **Company stage**: Seed → Series A → Growth → Enterprise
2. **Traffic scale**: 100s → thousands → millions
3. **Metric type**: Conversion, engagement, retention, quality
4. **Effect size**: Incremental → transformational
5. **Risk profile**: Exploratory → high-stakes
6. **User segment**: New → power users → churned
7. **Industry**: Rotate through all company types

## Quality Guidelines

1. **Uniqueness**: Each scenario should feel distinct and fresh
2. **Realism**: Use metrics appropriate for the industry and company stage
3. **Specificity**: Name the exact element being tested
4. **Consistency**: All parameters must be mathematically consistent
5. **Educational value**: Create scenarios that teach different aspects of experimentation
6. **Narrative quality**: Tell a compelling story with business stakes
